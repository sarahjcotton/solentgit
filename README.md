#What is version control 

- A Version control system is simply a tool that helps individuals and teams manage changes in their projects over time. 

- Traditionally version control was used to manage programming source code. However non programmers such as designers have increasingly been using version control as part of their workflow.

- It's tempting to think - "Why don't I just use cloud storage such as DropBox".  While using cloud storage is better than nothing, using version control has the following advantages:

	- **History:** you get a complete history of changes in your project 
	- **Peace of mind:** you can develop new features in isolation 
	- **Disaster recovery:** you can roll back your work to a working version at any time

#What is gitHub 
GitHub is one of many places that can be used to remotley store source code. Code is edited locally and then 'pushed' to the remote repository once changes have been made. If several people are collaborating on a repository, changes made by one person can be pushed to the remote repo then pulled back down and merged into someone else's local repo.
